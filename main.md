# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

My client, L.Y., has developed a new interest in the fascinating world of hydroponics. He decided to keep one specimen of hydroponics in his room for personal use and potentially academic experiments. He occasionally puts the plant out to a different location in the campus when the room environment is too unsuitable. Yet after a week of closely paying attention to and maintaining proper care for the plant, he realized that the plant showed some alarming visual signs of weakening color and general shape. After some online investigation, he had determined that the possible cause of this problem was the temperature of the room where the plant was kept being too low, the humidity levels being too high or perhaps too low, and the atmospheric pressure being lower due to the high altitude. Based on this knowledge, he felt that he needed to carefully monitor and successfully manage those particular variables that, one way or another, had a strong influence on the growth and overall health of the plant. Additionally, he wants to determine when and how long the plant should be located in the alternate position. Overall, my client is concerned about the lack of environmental monitoring capabilities both indoors and outdoors, for the wellbeing of his plant.

## Proposed Solution
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure, and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Additionally, BME280 sensor is an affordable, satisfactory contender for providing high accuracy atmospheric pressure data through I2C communication, one of the required variables for the client (Pressure range: 300hPa to 1100 hPa)[^5]. Connecting the DHT11 sensor and BME280 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Raspberry Pi 3b+ single-board computer [^3]. "The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins, allowing you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT)."[^4]. In additon to the low cost of the Raspberry Pi (< 60USD), this device is programable and expandable, with features such as internet connection[^4]. I considered alternatives such different versions of the Raspberry Pi but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constrains of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python's open-source nature and platform independence contribute to the long-term viability of the system. The use of Python simplifies potential future enhancements or modifications, allowing for seamless scalability without the need for extensive redevelopment. [^6]. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction [^7]. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is responsability of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory [^7], this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues proptly.

_TOK Connection: To what extent does ```the use of data science``` in climate research influence our understanding of environmental issues, and what knowledge questions arise regarding the ```reliability, interpretation, and ethical implications``` of data-driven approaches in addressing climate change_

1. How does our use of technology shape our understanding of the environment
```Technology greatly influences the perception of the environment because of the delivery of data, quite accurately and in real-time, that would have been impossible to retrieve without such systems. These data provide the capability of detecting subtle changes and patterns in environmental conditions that might not have been detected otherwise. But at the same time, it has to be recognized that it is our very technological toolsets that frame the perspective and so must considered. ```
2. What responsibilities do we have as technologists when it comes to handling personal data related to our living spaces?
```As personal data management technologists, interested in living spaces, data privacy and security should be observed. Transparency is needed in the methods of collection, storage, and usage of data, and consent shall be informed and obtained from the persons in whose living spaces the monitoring is conducted. Further, we are ethically committed to handling this kind of data responsibly, never misusing or exploiting personal information of any kind. ``` 
3. What cultural and contextual factors might impact our interpretation of the results, especially when comparing our local readings with those from the campus? 
```While cultural and contextual factors are generally important in data interpretation, their impact is minimal in our case of comparing local data to that of the school. Our focus on standardized measurements of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure ensures objectivity, minimizing subjective influences. Any variations we observe are more likely due to differences in measurement locations or equipment rather than cultural interpretations.```

**Fig.2**  This flowchart describes the process of continuously reading sensor data, extracting relevant information, and sending it to a server for further processing. The process is repeated indefinitely, with a delay of 1 second between each iteration and a pause of 1 minute between each measurement.

**Fig.3** The flowchart demonstrates a smoothing function that reduces noise in a given dataset. It takes a window size and a list of raw data as input. The function iterates through the data, calculates the average of a window of data points, and appends the average to a new list. This process continues until all data points are processed, resulting in a smoothed dataset.

**Fig.4** The flowchart outlines a process for fetching data from a server, filtering it based on a specific sensor ID, and then plotting the filtered data over time. The data is processed and visualized using various libraries, and a smoothing technique is applied to the plot for better readability.




## Data storing method

### Online API Server
The data of temperature, humidity, and pressure is being stored in an online API server: http://192.168.4.137/readings. Every 1 minute for 48 hours, the program will send data to the server. As there are 2 sensors, each minute, the server will receive a total of 5 data: 2 temperature data (DHT11 and BME280), 2 humidity data (DHT11 and BME280), and 1 atmospheric pressure data (only BME280) . The data will be sent to the server in a particular format. The following is an example of the 5 data sent each time:
```.py

{"sensor_id": 203, "value": 18.0, "datetime": "2024-12-04T22:40:00.016697", "id": 6181253}, {"sensor_id": 204, "value": 31.0, "datetime": "2024-12-04T22:40:00.016697", "id": 6181254}, {"sensor_id": 206, "value": 29.813148, "datetime": "2024-12-04T22:40:00.016697", "id": 6181255}, {"sensor_id": 210, "value": 884.3764, "datetime": "2024-12-04T22:40:00.016697", "id": 6181256}, {"sensor_id": 205, "value": 18.399817, "datetime": "2024-12-04T22:40:00.016697", "id": 6181257}

```
Each data tells different information separated by commas, the first element tells the sensor id of one of the DHT 11 and BME280 sensors and each sensor represents some of temperature, humidity, and pressure. We set the sensors as follows :
1. Sensor id 203 - the temperature sensor of DHT11
2. Sensor id 204 - the humidity sensor of DHT11 
3. Sensor id 205 - the temperature sensor of BME280 
4. Sensor id 206 - the humidity sensor of BME280 
5. Sensor id 210 - the pressure sensor of BME280 

The second element, “value”, tells the value of either temperature(celcius), humidity(%), and the pressure(hPa). The third element “datetime”, tells the date (Year-Month-Day) and the time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. The fourth element, “id” shows the id of the data. 

For example, this data, {"sensor_id": 203, "value": 18.0, "datetime": "2024-12-04T22:40:00.016697", "id": 6181253}, shows that the sensor detects temperature as the sensor id is “203”. It also shows that the temperature is 18 degrees Celsius, the id of this sensor is 6181253, and the date of the data is 4th December 2024 at 8pm 40 minutes.

# Criteria C: Development

## List of techniques used

1. API communication with remote server
2. Filtering using moving average
3. Plotting x-axis with hourly format

### 1. API communication with remote server

To solve **SC#5**: data backup to a remote server, and address **SC#1**/**SC#3**/SC#4: acquire data from a remote location, we needed a way to pull and push data to a server from both Raspberry Pi and personal computer. We used UWC ISAK Japan Weather API as our server: a centralized database for values such as temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure measured regularly on campus. In order to communicate with the server, we used an HTTP python library called `Requests`, which enable us to get and post data with simple coding[^9].
```.py
import requests

server_ip = '192.168.4.137'
request = requests.get(f'http://{server_ip}/readings')
data = request.json()
readings = data['readings'][0]

sensor_205 = []

for r in readings:
    if r['sensor_id'] == 205:
        print((r['value'],r['datetime']))
```
This is a basic representation of the pulling procedure to the personal computer from the server. The program first specifies the IP address of the server, then uses the `.get` method, which sends a GET request to the specified url. To the returned JSON response object, using `.json()` converts the body into a python object, in this case a dictionary. With appropriate arrangement of key access and "if" conditions, the program can acquire the desired data from a specific sensor or datetime.

```.py
import requests

server_ip="192.168.4.137"
user={ 'username':'example','password':'example'}

answer= requests.post(f'http://{server_ip}/login', json=user)
cookie=answer.json()['access_token']

auth = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {cookie}"}
new_record = {"sensor_id":203, "value":temp_dht, "datetime":now}  # temp_dht: value read from DHT11  now: datetime.now()
answer = requests.post(f'http://{server_ip}/reading/new', json = new_record, headers = auth)
```
This is a basic representation of the upload procedure from the Raspberry Pi to the server. Authorization is done using the `.post` method towards the login url, which will send a POST request with the username and password for a user which already had been registered to the server. Its answer provides an access token which can be used for the header for posting the sensor values. The posting of the data is also done using the `.post` method but now directed towards new readings url, taking the dictionary object which will be converted to json.

### 2. Pushing sensor measurements data promptly

To record 48 hours of consecutive data with an interval of one minute, we needed to have a program which sends measurements with accurate frequency. We first tried to use `time.sleep(60)` inside a loop, which suspends the following lines by the value given, just like below[^10].
```.py
while True:
    # Sending process comes here
    time.sleep(60)
```
However, we realized that with method, if the 'sending process' has its own processing time, the execution of the loop will be delayed by having extra elapsed time in addition to the `time.sleep(60)`. That will cause a shift in the interval which might accumulate into having less data than expected. So, we realized that we need to adjust the suspension, ideally dynamic. We thought of calculating the elapsed time during the 'sending process' and subtracting the value from `time.sleep(60)`, which looks like below.
```.py
while True:
    start = time.time()
    # Sending process comes here
    end = time.time()
    time.sleep(60-(end-start))
```
Because `time.time()` will give us the elapsed time from 1970 January 1st to the line executed in floating-point numbers[^10], calculating the difference between `start` and `end` will give us the accurate elapsed time. However, testing this code out revealed that the effects were trivial, and we thought it is not a fundamental approach to our objective, which was for the code to send measurements on time with consistent intervals. Therefore, we have changed our method and thought of a way to send the measurements corresponding to the conditions based on time, which is below.
```.py
while True:
    now = datetime.now()  # gets the local time in datetime object
    now = str(now) # coverts to string ("Year-Month-Date Hour:Minute:Second" format. Second is floating-point number")
    nowsec = now.split()[1].split(":")[2]  # splits "Year-Month-Date Hour:Minute:Second" into two by space and takes the second one, then takes the third element divided by colons, which is 'seconds'
    
    if float(nowsec) <= 0.9:
        # Sending process comes here
        time.sleep(1)
```
Here, the program gets into the sending process only if the condition `float(nowsec) <= 0.9` is met. Variable `nowsec` is the 'seconds' element of the instantaneous timestamp acquired by `datetime.now()`. Overall, `float(nowsec) <= 0.9` condition determines that whenever the program is sending the measurements, its 'seconds' are a roundnumber (e.g. 15:01:00). If its not a roundnumber, the measurements would not be sent because the condition explicitly limits the 'seconds' to be 0.9, practically less than zero. `time.sleep(1)` at the end of the loop prevents the program from re-entering the measuring process again instantaneously after a send, by making the condition impossible to meet ({nowsec < 0.9} is unachievable when {nowsec = previous nowsec + 1}). This method allows the program to send measurements promptly each minute.

### 3. Read values and timestamps of the recorded data in the server



### 4. Filtering using moving average

To solve SC#1 I encounter the problem that the values from teh sensors are noisy due to the changes in the
temperature and other variables. I thought about using an algorithm to filter the data and smooth it. After some reseach
I decided to use the moving average. To make things more sustainable and organized I decided to use a function to
implemented the moving average and placed it in a library.
```.py
def moving_average(windowSize:int, x:list)->list:
    # this function has a purpose to increase the readability of the graph by regulating the oscillation of the data.
    # the output is the smoothed list
    x_smoothed = []
    for i in range(0, len(x)-windowSize):
        x_section = x[i:i+windowSize]
        x_average = sum(x_section)/windowSize
        x_smoothed += [x_average]

    return x_smoothed
```
In the code above, we can see that the function signature includes two inputs, ```windowSize:int ``` is the size used for filtering which is of
data type integer that decides the range of values which the function will generate averages from, into ```x_smoothed```. Another input is ```x```, which is a list that the function will apply the smoothing to. All the values in ```x``` are intended to be integers or floats.
